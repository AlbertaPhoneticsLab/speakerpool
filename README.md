# SpeakerPool
SpeakerPool is a platform for remote speech data collection. It uses the Flask microapplication framework which is written in Python and runs in a web browser.

### Update
I am currently presenting SpeakerPool at the 183rd meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in Nashville. Documentation is still being written, but SpeakerPool will soon be available for use. Follow this repository to stay tuned!
