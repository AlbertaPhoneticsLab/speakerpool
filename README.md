# SpeakerPool
SpeakerPool is a platform for remote speech data collection. It uses the Flask microapplication framework which is written in Python and can run in a web browser on most devices. SpeakerPool is a solution for those who do not know how to (or do not want to) code their own application but would like to collect speech recordings from participants online.

### Update
I am currently presenting SpeakerPool at the 183rd meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in Nashville. Documentation is still being written, but SpeakerPool will soon be available for use. Follow this repository to stay tuned!
